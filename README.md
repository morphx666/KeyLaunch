# KeyLaunch
The first Windows keyboard-oriented finder and launcher

A simple searching application with a very unique implementation. An app launcher, as known by then.

The thing is that, contrary to how most app launchers worked back in the time, this one made searching programs and files in general extremely easy:

- Hit a shortcut key to launch the finder
- Type a couple of keywords
- Select the desired file from a list of matches

Sounds familiar? Well, of course it does! It is the way [Spotlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_%28software%29) and the [Start Menu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu) work! Wait, that’s also how the dreaded [Start Screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_screen#Start_screen) in Windows 8 works!

Version 3.0 adds several new features that makes KeyLaunch a really nice application that, if it were ever been made public, I’m sure a lot of people would’ve liked it.

The first thing you’ll notice, if you have ever used KeyLaunch before, is the new user interface.

Here’s a screenshot of version 2.x:

Here’s a list of some of the most important improvements over version 2.x:

- Much nicer interface
- Fully realizable interface
- Easier configuration
- [Customizable shortcut-able Categories based on files types](http://whenimbored.xfx.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/kl-categories1.png)
- Ability to open the folder containing the selected file

Although 3.0 is considerably more advanced than version 2.x, there are several features missing, such as:

- The ability to perform operations over file from the search results window:

- Show the file’s properties
- Rename / Copy
- Select the file within the Explorer window when the parent folder is opened
- It’s a bit faster. Version 3.0’s eye-candy slows it a bit but that can be fixed since 3.0’s code is over a decade old and .NET wasn’t as mature as it is to day and I didn’t know 0.1% of what I know today — so I’m sure the code can be vastly improved
- …among other minor (but nice) features…
